# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.

# Instructions:
# 1. Read a text file called "input.txt" and print its contents to the console.
# 2. Create a new file called "output.txt" and write the following modifications:
#    - Convert all text to uppercase.
#    - Replace all occurrences of the word "Python" with "JavaScript".
# 3. Print a message indicating that the modifications have been saved to "output.txt".
# 4. Handle any potential errors (e.g., file not found) gracefully.
# 5. Use functions to organize your code.
# 6. Include comments to explain your code.
# 7. Use exception handling to manage errors.
# 8. Use the 'with' statement for file operations to ensure proper resource management.
# 9. Use the os module to check if the input file exists before attempting to read it.
